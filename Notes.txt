Goals of the game:
1.) To create a fun simulation experience for the player to deal with.

I want the Player to experience the same sort of joy they get when they
play the sims, and the randomly generated storylines that they are part of
but also can affect. Pros will say toxic things on social media. Pros
will get significant others and quit playing professionally. Pros will
be poached. Pros will gain and lose sponsorships. Pros will start
drama with other Pros. Pros will have medical issues, family issues,
personal issues. Pros will have birthdays.

2.) To create a fun RPG-like progression system.

The Player will enjoy watching his pros get more competent. They will
get better at the game in many specific ways (laning, roaming, champ pool, etc)
They will get better at things outside of the game. They will get better
at streaming, which increases your cash flow. They will get more social
media influence. They will start as no name rookies and become famous pros,
storied veterans, or just washed-up contestents.

The Player will also enjoy watching his team grow. They will start with a
low level headquarters (Mom's basement) and end up in an Esports-Facility,
kitted with gyms, kitchens, chefs, staff, sensory deprivation pods, etc.
The team itself will go from unheard of amateur team, to getting into the
Proving Grounds circuit (will be renamed), to the Pro circuit.
The team will start off playing in local free for fun tournaments, and
progress to big esports events with thousands of viewers.
The team will eventually earn sponsorships and fans.
The team will get more money and influence and be able to afford better
players, coaches, staff, etc.

3.) To create a fun Autobattler to simulate the pro matches

The actual matches will be represented with an Autobattler game. It will
have turn based decisions that the Player can make (perhaps choose which
lane to gank in an RPS-like system), and the drafting phase. It is very
important that this Autobattler is fun, because it will happen a lot. It
should be at least as fun as a Pokemon Battle.


4.) To tell a competent story

There will be a basic story to complete (start off in mom's basement,
end up winning the ultimate finals tournament). The majority of the
storyline will be told through random events and player decisions,
but what storyline does exist should be compelling.

5.) To have eSports inside jokes

There will be many references to things that happen in the eSports
community.

depending on what you can afford you can make an amazing "deck"
I'm gonna give them random perks (super situational perks) and negative buffs(like "doesnt shower") or whatever
it'll be like the d2 affix system for items haha
